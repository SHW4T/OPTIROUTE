# OPTIROUTE : Delivery Route Optimization Web App


This web application allows users to find the optimal delivery route between two locations using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet Routing Machine. Built as a mini-project for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course in 2024.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Visualize routes on an interactive map powered by OpenStreetMap.
- **Custom Start & End:** Enter any start and end coordinates to find the best route.
- **Responsive UI:** Simple, clean interface with a hamburger menu for project credits.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Mapping:** [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- **Routing:** [Leaflet Routing Machine](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) (uses OSRM)
- **Base Map:** [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

## How Does Routing Work?

This project uses **Leaflet Routing Machine**, which by default relies on the [Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)](http://project-osrm.org/) for route calculation.  
**OSRM** implements advanced shortest path algorithms, primarily **Dijkstra's algorithm** and the **A\* (A-star) algorithm**, to efficiently compute the fastest or shortest route between two points on real-world road networks.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
3. **Enter start and end coordinates (latitude,longitude) and click "Find Route".**
